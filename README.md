# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter to uncover trends for Louise looking to start her own Kickstarter campaign for her play and a future musical in Great Britain with a goal of $4,000. 
---
I recommend Louise launching her Kickstarter Campaign for her play in June as that is when most of the successful campaigns are launched.
Successful campaigns also had a mean goal of $5,049 with mean pledge exceeding the goal at $5,602 and a median goal of $3,000 with a median pledge exceeding this at $3,168 whereas the fialed campaigns had a mean goal of $10,554 and mean pledged of only $559 and a median goal of $5,000 a median pledge of only $103. 
This data tells us that having too high of a goal is correlated with having lower pledges so Louise's goal of $4,000 is not too high and should receive enough money pledged

# Conclusions
---
1) Based on Outcomes Based on Goal line chart, campaigns with goals between $0 - $4,999 saw the highest percentage of success, between 70% - 80%. However, Louise's campaign was part of the remaining 30% - 20% of unsuccessful campaign with a goal between $0 - $4,999.

2) Based on Outcomes Based on Launch Date line chart, most of the successful campaigns were launched in May. June was the second most successful month, and the month that Louise's campaign was launched, but her campaign failed.

3) There were six other campaigns that also almost met their campaign goal (between 80% - 99% funded) in a short period of time (under 37 days). The conclusion I found from this data is that longer campaigns do not necessarily get closer to reaching their goal. In fact, the trend line for Percentage Funded is actually sloping downward, as the Campaign Length grows in days, indicating that the longer a campaign, the further it is from being 100% funded.

# Limitations
---
1) The data does not include more qualitative data including who the creator of the kickstarter camapaign is. If it is someone famous, or someone who has had other successful kickstarter campaigns, that would be interesting to see. 
2) The data does not show the amount spent on advertising for promoting the kickstarted campaign. If we had that data we would be able to determine Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) to see how much money was truly raised for the campaign.

# Suggestions for Additional Tables and Graphs
---
1) I would combine the two graphs to be able to see the Outcomes based on Goal and Launch Dates. This would help me compare campaigns that are even more similar to Louise's. 
2) I would look at Outcomes Based on length of campaign to see what the most common length of successful campaigns is. This can be calculated by finding the mode of campaign length.
