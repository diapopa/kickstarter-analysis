# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter to uncover trends for Louise looking to start her own Kickstarter campaign for her play and a future musical in Great Britain with a goal of $4,000. 
---
I recommend Louise launching her Kickstarter Campaign for her play in June as that is when most of the successful campaigns are launched.

Successful campaigns also had a meal goal of $5,049 with mean pledge exceeding the goal at $5,602 and a median goal of $3,000 with a median pledge exceeding this at $3,168 whereas the fialed campaigns had a mean goal of $10,554 and mean pledged of only $559 and a median goal of $5,000 a median pledge of only $103. 
This data tells us that having too high of a goal is correlated with having lower pledges so I recommend Louisa set her goal to $5,000 for her play's Kickstarter campaign.
